    "My goal is to understand how the brain allows us to sense, evaluate and respond to the world around us. We are actively working on methods to re-wire and repair eye-to-brain connections in common blinding diseases such as glaucoma. A second line of work deals with visually-evoked emotions and how perception combines with internal states to drive behavior.",

  citate:
    "When nothing seems to help, I go look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before.",
